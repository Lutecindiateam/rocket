 *                   and <style> nodes will be processed.
 * @param {string}   [options.include="style,link[rel=stylesheet]"] CSS selector
 *                   matching <link re="stylesheet"> and <style> nodes to

 * @param {object}   [options.variables] A map of custom property name/value
 *                   pairs. Property names can omit or include the leading

 *                   previous values
 * @param {boolean}  [options.onlyLegacy=true] Determines if the ponyfill will
 *                   only generate legacy-compatible CSS in browsers that lack
 *                   native support (i.e., legacy browsers)
 * @param {boolean}  [options.preserveStatic=true] Determines if CSS
 *                   declarations that do not reference a custom property will
 *                   be preserved in the transformed CSS
 * @param {boolean}  [options.preserveVars=false] Determines if CSS custom

 *                   <style> DOM mutation is observed
 * @param {function} [options.onBeforeSend] Callback before XHR is sent. Passes
 *                   1) the XHR object, 2) source node reference, and 3) the
 *                   source URL as arguments
 * @param {function} [options.onError] Callback after a CSS parsing error has
 *                   occurred or an XHR request has failed. Passes 1) an error
 *                   message, and 2) source node reference, 3) xhr, and 4 url as
 *                   arguments.

 *                   3) the source URL as arguments.
 * @param {function} [options.onComplete] Callback after all CSS has been
 *                   processed, legacy-compatible CSS has been generated, and
 *                   (optionally) the DOM has been updated. Passes 1) a CSS
 *                   string with CSS variable values resolved, 2) an array of
 *                   output <style> node references that have been appended to
 *                   the DOM, 3) an object containing all custom properies names

 *                   milliseconds.
 * @param {function} [options.onFinally] Callback in modern and legacy browsers
 *                   after the ponyfill has finished all tasks. Passes 1) a
 *                   boolean indicating if the last ponyfill call resulted in a
 *                   style change, 2) a boolean indicating if the current
 *                   browser provides native support for CSS custom properties,
 *                   and 3) the ponyfill execution time in milliseconds.

 *                   text content. This is required to get accurate CSS data
